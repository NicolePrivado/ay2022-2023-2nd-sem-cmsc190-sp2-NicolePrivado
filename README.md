# UPLB Cashier Notification Services: Data Security using Advanced Encryption Standard
Authors: Andrea Nicole G. Privado and Concepcion L. Khan

The study presents an alternative to the SMS notifications currently employed by UPLB Cashier. It succeeded in developing a mobile application for employee users and a web application for admin users. It has also been able to implement end-to-end encryption for mobile notifications and a data encryption algorithm when writing and accessing sensitive data from the database using the Advanced Encryption Standard. 

A mean score of 82.5 (web app) and 92.5 (mobile app) was obtained from the System Usability Testing (SUS) which implies that the system has an above-average to excellent usability. A result of ’Threat Level 1’ is obtained from a web vulnerability scan which implies that no severe or critical vulnerabilities were detected in the web application. Lastly, the result ’All tested parameters do not appear to be injectable.’ has been obtained from an SQL injection testing performed in one of the server’s HTTP request URLs.
